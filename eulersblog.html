            <p>Hi, I'm Charlotte! Welcome to my blog where I document my journey through solving problems on Project Euler.</p>
            <p>I am new to the world of coding and was recommended to sign up to <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.</p>
            <p>I jumped at the opportunity as it seemed like a perfect place to practise my coding, improve my logic and keep my maths skills sharp.</p>
            <p>This is where I will document my journey through solving problems on Project Euler.</p>
            <p>Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A good understanding of programming is also necessary.</p>
            <p>I will be sharing my solutions, thought processes, and any challenges I encounter along the way, in the hope to help further my own abilities and also guide you with my own misconceptions.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my blog and follow along as I tackle these intriguing problems!</p>

            <h2 class="title">Problem 0</h2>
            <h3>Among the first 636 thousand square numbers, what is the sum of all the odd squares?</h3>

            <div class="problem">
                <p>This is the initial porblem you need to solve in order to get started on Project Euler.</p>
                <p>I decided to use c++ for this problem.</p>
                <p>When I started writing my code for this problem I was getting the incorrect answer and couldn't work out why as I knew my maths logic was correct.</p>
                <p>By using the code below, I found I was getting negative square numbers, which obviously made zero sense as all square numbers are positive.</p>
                <pre><code>
    std::cout << "The last square number is " << squares.back() << std::endl;
                </code></pre>
                <p>This was because I had used <em>'int'</em> instead of <em>'long int'</em> when defining my vectors.</p>
                <p>Once I changed this, I was able to get the correct answer.</p>
                <h3><a href="#problem_0">My Solution</a></h3>
                
                <pre id="problem_0"><code>

    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>
                        
    int main() {

        std::vector<long int> squares;
        for(long int i = 1; i <= 636000 ; i++){
            squares.push_back(i*i);

        std::vector<long int> odd_squares;
        for(long int a = 0; a < squares.size(); a++){
            if (squares[a] % 2 != 0){
                odd_squares.push_back(squares[a]);

        long int odd_sum = 0;
        for (long int c = 0; c < odd_squares.size(); c++){

            <h2 class="title">Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5</h2>
            <h3>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</h3>

            <div class="problem">
                 <p>I decided to stick with c++ to solve this problem.</p>
                 <p>This was a great problem to start with as it was fairly straightforward and I was able to solve it fairly quickly.
                    I used a for loop to iterate through all the numbers below 1000 and an if statement to check if each number was a multiple of 3 or 5.
                    But found I still got the wrong answer. I'm starting to think this is a common theme with my coding journey so far!</p>
                 <p>After editing the code to test with smaller numbers, I found that I was <strong>including</strong> 1000 in my calculations when I should not have been.</p>
                 <p>Once I realised my mistake it was an easy fix and then I got the correct answer.</p>
