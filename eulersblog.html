            <p>Hi, I'm Charlotte! Welcome to my blog where I document my journey through solving problems on Project Euler.</p>
            <p>I am new to the world of coding and was recommended to sign up to <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.</p>
            <p>I jumped at the opportunity as it seemed like a perfect place to practise my coding, improve my logic and keep my maths skills sharp.</p>
            <p>This is where I will document my journey through solving problems on Project Euler.</p>
            <p>Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A good understanding of programming is also necessary.</p>
            <p>I will be sharing my solutions, thought processes, and any challenges I encounter along the way, in the hope to help further my own abilities and also guide you with my own misconceptions.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my blog and follow along as I tackle these intriguing problems!</p>

            <h3>Among the first 636 thousand square numbers, what is the sum of all the odd squares?</h3>

            <div class="problem">
                <h4>Language used: C++</h4>
                <p>This is the initial porblem you need to solve in order to get started on Project Euler.</p>
                <p>When I started writing my code for this problem I was getting the incorrect answer and couldn't work out why as I knew my maths logic was correct.</p>
                <p>By using the code below, I found I was getting negative square numbers, which obviously made zero sense as all square numbers are positive.</p>
                <pre><code>
    std::cout << "The last square number is " << squares.back() << std::endl;
                </code></pre>
                <p>This was because I had used <em>'int'</em> instead of <em>'long int'</em> when defining my vectors.</p>
                <p>Once I changed this, I was able to get the correct answer.</p>

            <h3>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. </h3>
            <h3>The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</h3>

            <div class="problem">
                 <h4>Language used: C++</h4>
                 <p>This was a great problem to start with as it was fairly straightforward and I was able to solve it fairly quickly.
                    I used a for loop to iterate through all the numbers below 1000 and an if statement to check if each number was a multiple of 3 or 5.
                    But found I still got the wrong answer. I'm starting to think this is a common theme with my coding journey so far!</p>
                 <p>After editing the code to test with smaller numbers, I found that I was <strong>including</strong> 1000 in my calculations when I should not have been.</p>
                 <p>Once I realised my mistake it was an easy fix and then I got the correct answer.</p>

            <h3>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... </h3>
            <h3>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</h3>

            <div class="problem">
                <h4>Language used: C++</h4>
                <p>When I saw this problem, I thought 'easy'. Again, Project Euler has taught me to eat my words as even though the logic of how to complete this seems easy, getting my code to do what I want is less so.</p>
                <p>My intinct was to first create a vector by using a for and while loop to add the two previous elements to create the next. I first tried this with a smaller value so it would be easier to see if my code works correctly.
                    I tried to do a while loop nested inside a for loop.</p>
                <pre><code>
    for(int i=2; i <= 20; i++){
        int c = 0;
        while(c <= 40){
            c = fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2];
            fib_seq.push_back(c);
        }
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>But this just created an endless loop, so I tried doing a for loop inside a while loop to see if I got a complete Fibonacci sequence.</p>
                <pre><code>
    int c;
    while(c <= 40){
        c = 0;
        for(int i=2; i <= 20; i++){
            c = fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2];
            fib_seq.push_back(c);
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>Despite not creating an endless loop and populating my fib_seq vector, because the for loop is inside the while loop it completely ignores the while condition and just completes the process until it has created 21 elements.
                    My next thought is to stick with a for loop, but nest an if conditional inside.</p>
                <p><em>It worked!</em> After a slight adaptation of my original code, giving c the value of the 3 and swapping the order of the executed code, I have a Fibonacci sequence that doesn't exceed 40.
                Continuing on the path of <strong>using a smaller value to make it easier to check</strong> I now plan to create a new vector of just the even values. To do this I will do a for loop with a nested if conditional checking the remainder when divided by 2.</p>
                <pre><code>
    //for loop and if conditional to fill the even_fib vector
    for(int i = 0; i < fib_seq.size(); i++){
        if(fib_seq[i]%2==0){
            even_fib.push_back(fib_seq[i]);
        }
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>Next, I had to find the sum of all the even numebrs and print to console. Once I completed this and checked that I got the correct answer, it was time to change the number from 40 to 4000000 and get the answer.</p>
                <p>I happy to say that I got the correct answer!</p>

            <div class="problem">
                <h4>Language used: JavaScript</h4>
                <p>I decided to challenge myself more and use JavaScript for this problem.</p>
                <p>My first thought was to find all the factors of value, so I wrote the code below to do this. But this proved impossible as there were too many for my array.</p>
                <pre><code>
    //Find factors of value
    for(let l = 1; l<=number; l++){
        if(number % l == 0){
            factors.push(l)
        }
    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>I found this problem really difficult, I initially made the same mistake I made previously and didn't read the problem well enough. 
                    I originally tried to find the largest prime number under 600851475143, which was proving a problem as I couldn't make an array big enough.</p>
                <p>Once I noticed my mistake, I decided to make an array of all the prime numbers below the squareroot of 600851475143, 
                    as the quickest way to test is a number is a prime number is to divide it by the prime numbers.</p>
                <p>I used for loops paired with if conditionals to create an array of prime factors of the value. Finally, I used Math.max() to find the largest prime factor.</p>
